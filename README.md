A `no_std` audio processing framework for embedded systems, inspired by ESP-ADF (Espressif Audio Development Framework). 

## Current Status

Development stage: **Initial Design Phase**

- [ ] Project structure setup
- [ ] Basic architecture design
- [ ] Core components implementation
- [ ] Audio pipeline
- [ ] Basic audio elements
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Examples
- [ ] Testing

## Planned Features

The framework aims to provide:

- Audio element pipeline system
- Support for various input streams (I2S, FileSystem, ADC ...)
- Multiple output streams (I2S, DAC ...)
- Audio format decoder
- Flexible audio processing chain
